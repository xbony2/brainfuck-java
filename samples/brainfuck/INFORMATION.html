		<p>This file gives information about the samples provide in this directory. Just to note, none of these were created 
		by me unless otherwise stated.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>hello_world.bf: prints "Hello World!" to the console.</li>
			<li>cat.bf: asks for input, and then returns what you had inputed; an echo program.</li>
			<li>self_interpreter.bf: this is a self-interpreter made by Daniel B. Cristofani. More 
			information <a href="http://www.hevanet.com/cristofd/brainfuck/dbfi.b">here</a>. I recommend not looking over if 
			you are looking for something basic to start with, it may be a little bit confusing.</li>
